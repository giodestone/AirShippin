# Air Shippin'

A simulator-come-game about delivering goods in the golden era of thermal blimp logistics. Made for GJL 2021 Game Parade Jam with the theme 'one time use' with a friend.

## Gameplay

The player is tasked with completing five deliveries to prove that they are employable. The job board creates some boxes for the player to take to another 'hub'. The player also has to consider the fuel usage by stocking up on single use containers. After the player loads up, they must increase the temperature of the blimp and change their heading match the 'TGT->HDG' heading (a Sea of Thieves-esque navigation system would have been perfect here). The player must also consider the wind at their altitude, and maybe consider using it to their advantage. The winds get stronger the further they go up though!

As the player uses more and more fuel canisters the temperature of the world goes up, making it harder to fly and do things, and making the world awfully orange.

The game was heavily inspired by another game jam game from 2013, [Aurora Wager](https://ramjetanvil.itch.io/the-aurora-wager).

## How To Play

**A Guide is contained within the game.** But you can read the beautiful PDF's here instead - [Page 1](https://github.com/giodestone/AirShippin/raw/main/Blimp%20Transport%20Bureau.pdf), [Page 2](https://github.com/giodestone/AirShippin/raw/main/Blimp%20Transport%20Bureau%20Meteo.pdf), [Page 3](https://github.com/giodestone/AirShippin/raw/main/Blimp%20Transport%20Bureau%20Ops.pdf), [Page 4](https://github.com/giodestone/AirShippin/raw/main/scanned%20ops.pdf), [Page 5](https://github.com/giodestone/AirShippin/raw/main/scanned%20ops%20pg%201.pdf).

If you really do not want to read them and be taken aback by the world-building, they are listed below.

<details>
  <summary>Spoil the controls.</summary>
    
    * W, A, S, D - move around.
    * Mouse - look.
    * Left mouse - Interact, place item, pick up item.
    * Right mouse - throw the 20kg or 45kg thing you're holding.
    * Shift - sprint.
    * Scroll- zoom.
    * Hold escape for five seconds to show restart button.
    * When focused on steering wheel:
        * shift + ctrl to increment/decrement the throttle. Reverse thrust exists!
        * a + d to steer.
        * esc to stop focusing.
